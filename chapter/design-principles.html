    <h1>Design Principles</h1>
      <p>
        The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation
        in team sports through
        online communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this
        goal if the application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are
        applied to achieve a user-centric solution.

    <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
    <p>The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple
        <cite>(NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.)</cite>. User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a
        company, its
        services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s
        needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering,
        marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design <cite>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</cite>.
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        »Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs
        so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the
        other
        hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.«

      User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the
      haptics, and the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors:
      its look, feel, and usability <cite>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04).</cite>
    </p>

  <div class="box">
    <dl>
        <dt>Look</dt>
        <dd>
          The “look” satisfies the user’s visual expectations of the product. It is about creating
          a product that is visually appealing and conveys the essence of the product
          to the user. In addition to pure aesthetics, it is also important that the content is
          communicated simply and understandably. Therefore, it is not only important
          how the product looks like but also how information is presented.
        </dd>

        <dt>Feel</dt>
        <dd>
          The “feel” is about creating products that are not only functional but also fun to
          use. It is important that it is a pleasant and intuitive experience when interacting
          with the product on a daily basis.
        </dd>

        <dt>Usability</dt>
        <dd>
          Usability is the cornerstone of user experience because if a product is difficult
          to use, the experience of using it will never be positive. Products should be designed
          to meet the needs of the user, and the product’s functions should be predictable
          for the user.

    <p>
      User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and
      behavior of the user. Understanding how users perceive a product allows user
      experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the user’s
      goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah Diefenbach’s paper Well-being,
      Need Fulfillment, and Experience Design, any positive experience is based on
      meeting psychological needs. The fulfillment of psychological needs, such as
      competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to
      the well-being of the user and leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience
      design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the design
      process 
      <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
      Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the
      following, they are considered from the perspective of emotion, while additional
      needs are addressed.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Competence</dt>
      <dd>
        Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective
        instead of thinking that one is incapable and incompetent 
        <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Relatedness</dt>
      <dd>
        Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with
        the people in the environment, rather than feeling lonely or unnoticed 
        <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Popularity</dt>
      <dd>
        Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than
        feeling like a person whose advice and opinion are ignored 
        <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Stimulation</dt>
      <dd>
        Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of
        feeling bored and understimulated 
        <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Security</dt>
      <dd>
        Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather
        than feeling uncertain and threatened by circumstances one cannot control
        <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating
      people to participate in various activities. Thus, it is also an important
      factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis addresses the question of
      how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the user’s
      participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid especially
      on relatedness.
      In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”.
      In addition to the approach of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other approaches
      define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P. Anderson,
      for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model 
      <cite>(→ FIG.05)</cite>. Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, this model
      is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed
      through six stages of maturity, during which they can grow from a purely
      functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user 
      <cite>(ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.)</cite>.
